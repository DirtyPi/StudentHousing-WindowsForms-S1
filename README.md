#studenthousing-app

One of the first school projects I made, that helped me understand the concept of OOP and made me use and understand the idea of GIT for the first time.


**Note:**
This project was originally hosted on GitLab and has been transferred to GitHub. As a result, the commit history for this repository starts from a single commit. This is because the project was cloned from GitLab and committed as a single commit in the new GitHub repository.
